## :blue_book: About

This is the final project of the [Explorer program by Rocketseat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/explorer), where the construction of a restaurant order management application was proposed.
Basically, the application has three personas:

- Visitor: has access to the home page, can search for dishes by name, view dishes in detail, and add products to the cart.
- Customer: has the same functionalities as a visitor, with the addition of being able to add products to favorites, complete a purchase, view all their past orders, check the status of a specific order, and update their profile information (name, email, password).
- Administrator: has the same access as a customer, with the exception of favoriting dishes and making orders, and the addition of being able to add new dishes, edit existing dishes, edit the status of an order, and view all orders made on the website.

</br>

## :briefcase: Usage

To use this project locally, you will first need to install the backend according to this [documentation](https://github.com/jescatolini/foodExplorer_API).

To begin, clone the project by executing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
  $git clone https://github.com/jescatolini/foodExplorer_API
```

Navigate to the project directory by using the following command:

```bash
  $cd ood_explorer-frontend
/
```

Install the project dependencies by running the following command in the project directory:

```bash
  $npm install
```

Set the environment variable according to the address generated by the backend. For example:

```JS
  VITE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3333

```

To start a local server for the frontend, use the following command:

```bash
  $npm run dev
```

If everything goes well, you will receive a message similar to this:

```bash
  VITE v4.3.9  ready in 383 ms

  ‚ûú  Local:   http://127.0.0.1:5173/
